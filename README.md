# Startup-sound
A Lua to play a startup sound when Stand runs.

## Credits  
Credit to aaronlink127 for the aalib.dll and for figuring sound stuff out.  
  
## Install  
Drag everything except the license and readme file into Lua Scripts.  

## Usage  
1. Go into Lua Scripts / store / startup_sound, and put your .wav file into there. Then edit sound.txt to be the name of your sound, like "beep.wav".
2. Run the Lua and don't stop it. Save your state/have auto-save state on so Stand will run the Lua when it's injected.
3. The sound will play when the Lua runs.
