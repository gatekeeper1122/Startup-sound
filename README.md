# Startup-sound
A Lua to play a startup sound when Stand runs.

## Credits  
Credit to aaronlink127 for the aalib.dll and for figuring sound stuff out.  
  
## Install  
Drag everything except the license and readme file into Lua Scripts.  

## Usage  
1. Run the lua at least once.  
2. Go into Lua Scripts / store / startup_sound, and put your .wav file into there. Then edit sound.txt to be the name of your sound, like "beep.wav".
3. The sound will play when the Lua runs, which should be when Stand injects if your state has the Lua set to run.
